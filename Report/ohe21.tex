\subsubsection{Triangle intersection}
To compute triangle intersections the Möller–Trumbore algorithm was used. This was used instead of the method on the \textit{slides} anticipating the requirements for the baracentric coordinates to complete Gouraud shading further in the coursework.

\subsubsection{Spotlights}

\subsubsection{Pointlights}
The slides refer to two methods to create pointlights, with and without an associated direction. As spot lights are directional, pointlights with a constant intensity were implemented. This allows a pointlight to be placed between objects to cast shadow outwa
