1. Clear explanation of the code
2. Brief, clear description of the theory/ methods/ algorithms
3. overview of the code development, including design decisions, problems encountered and how these were overcome
  1. overview
    1. Lab 1 - Rasterising Lines
    2. Lab 2 - Reading Models
    3. Lab 3 - Simple Raytracing
    4. Lab 4 - Basic Lighting
      Spot light and Point light added. Point light has no direction (no fall off)

    5. Reflection and Refraction    
    6. Photon mapping
    5. Adv Feature

  2. design decisions
  2. problems
    1.  Issue with multiple planes and a spot light - capped the shadow fcn to light length
      Issue was that the plane was self casting on to another.
