# CM30075
Advanced Graphics CW

## Labs Setup - 30%
### Lab 1 - Rasterising Lines - 5%
Replacing the given line drawing function in linedrawer.cpp with an integer based one.

### Lab 2 -  Reading Models - 5%
Filling in the missing code in polymesh.cpp in order to read 3D object files. Allowing to generate a rasterised, wireframe image of the model

### Lab 3 - Simple Raytracing - 10%
* Creating a raycaster to render the teapot. 
* Raycasting structure (5%)
* Triangle intersection (5%)

### Lab 4 - Basic Lighting - 10%
Local lighting
* Ambient
* Diffuse
* Specular lighting (5%) 
* Shadows (5%)

## Project and Report - 60%
* Reflection and Refraction (10%)
* Photon-Mapping (40%)
* One additional Feature (10%)
  * CSG
  * Textures
  * Procedural Geometry / Shading
  * Depth of Field 

## Final Image - 10%
* Minimum 512x512 sized image using the teapot dataset
* Using the code from the Project submission

## Marking guide
### Good quality code
* Make use of sensible names for functions, classes, variables, etc.
* Have a sensible structure that is efficient where appropriate.
* Make use of comments to assist the reader to follow the functionality. 
* Clearly indicate any code that is not your own and cite the source
* Work
### Good quality report
* A clear explanation of the objective of the code.
* A brief, clear description of the theory/methods/algorithms employed. 
* An overview of the code developed, including any design decisions taken, problems encountered and how these were overcome. 
* Appropriate diagrams/illustrations/renderings to assist the readers understanding.
* Appropriate references to any literature that has been relied on
### Good quality images will
* Consist of a scene that is of sufficient complexity to demonstrate the key features of the raytracer
* Avoid artefacts that detract from the image such as excessive noise or low-resolution
* Show some level of artistic merit in the composition.
